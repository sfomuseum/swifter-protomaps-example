This is a simple iOS (and Mac Catalyst) application to demonstrate use of the [sfomuseum/swifter-protomaps](https://github.com/sfomuseum/swifter-protomaps) package.

It bundles a [Protomaps](https://github.com/protomaps/) tile database for the San Francisco International Airport (SFO, launches an instance of the [httpswifter/swifter](https://github.com/httpswift/swifter) HTTP server running on `localhost:9001` that will serve requests for those tiles and displays a single ViewController that loads a web application for displaying the tiles.
